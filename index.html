                <p class="paragraph-text">The “Recollection” Project started as the idea of porting a Minecraft world from the latest version of Infdev to 1.19.2 – an interesting experiment, as the methods for world generation changed throughout the years.</p>
                <p class="paragraph-text">As of February 1st, 2023, I (we) decided that I (we) would rather turn this quick experiment into a full playthrough, as to appreciate all of the features we got throughout the years, give my (our) insight on design changes and see how a player would adapt to the evolution of Minecraft.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-text">This project will walk us through every step and measure that I (we) take to make sure that the world stands the test of time. I (we) will be using map editors and other external tools to make sure that core parts of the world stay intact as new terrain generation overwrites the old.</p>
